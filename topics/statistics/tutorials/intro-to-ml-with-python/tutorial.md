Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It has revolutionized various fields, from healthcare and finance to autonomous vehicles and natural language processing.

This tutorial is designed to equip you with essential knowledge and skills in Machine Learning, setting a strong foundation for exploring advanced topics such as Deep Learning.

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce you to some foundational aspects of Machine Learning which are key to delve in other topics such as Deep Learning. Our focus will be on high-level strategies and decision-making processes related to data and objectives, rather than delving into the intricacies of specific algorithms and models. This approach will help you understand the broader context and applications of Machine Learning.

We will concentrate on supervised learning, where the goal is to predict a "target" variable based on input data. In supervised learning, the target variable can be:

- **Categorical**: In this case, we are performing **classification**, where the objective is to assign input data to predefined categories or classes.
- **Continuous**: Here, we are conducting **regression**, aiming to predict a continuous value based on the input data.

While classification and regression employ different models and evaluation metrics, many of the underlying strategies and principles are shared across both types of tasks.

In this tutorial, we will explore a practical example using a transcriptomics dataset to predict phenotypic traits in potatoes, specifically focusing on potato coloration. The dataset has been pre-selected and normalized to include the 200 most promising genes out of approximately 15,000, as proposed by {% cite acharjee2016integration %}. This real-world application will help you understand how to apply Machine Learning techniques to solve practical problems.

# Prepare resources

Let's start by preparing the environment

## Install dependencies

The first step is to install the required dependencies if they are not already installed:

```python
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install numpy
!pip install pandas
!pip install seaborn
!pip install scikit-learn
```

## Import tools

Let's now import them.

```python
import matplotlib.pylab as pylab
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
```

## Configure for plotting

For plotting, we will use Matplotlib, a popular plotting library in Python. We would like to customize the appearance of plots to enhance readability and ensure that all plots generated during the tutorial will have a consistent and professional appearance, making them easier to read and interpret:

```python
pylab.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = 5, 5
plt.rc("font", size=10)

plt.rc("xtick", color="k", labelsize="medium", direction="in")
plt.rc("xtick.major", size=8, pad=12)
plt.rc("xtick.minor", size=8, pad=12)

plt.rc("ytick", color="k", labelsize="medium", direction="in")
plt.rc("ytick.major", size=8, pad=12)
plt.rc("ytick.minor", size=8, pad=12)
```

# Get data

Let's now get the data. As mentioned in the introduction, we will use data from {% cite acharjee2016integration %} where they used transcriptomics dataset to predict potato coloration. The dataset has been pre-selected and normalized to include the 200 most promising genes out of approximately 15,000.

First, let's import the metadata of the studied potatoes:

```python
file_metadata = "https://github.com/sib-swiss/statistics-and-machine-learning-training/raw/refs/heads/main/data/potato_data.phenotypic.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file_metadata, index_col=0)
```

For the sake of our story, we will imagine that out of the 86 potatoes in the data, we have only 73 at the time of our experiment. We put aside the rest for later.

```python
i1 = df.index[:73]
i2 = df.index[73:]
```

We are interested in the colors of the potatoes, stored in the `Flesh Colour` column:

```python
y = df.loc[i1, "Flesh Colour"]
```

Let's look at the distribution of the values:

```python
sns.histplot(y)
```

![Bar chart depicting the distribution of a dataset categorized by 'Flesh Colour.' The x-axis represents different ranges of flesh colour values, while the y-axis indicates the count of occurrences within each range. The chart shows the highest frequency in the 10-20 range, followed by a gradual decline in counts as the flesh colour values increase. The counts decrease more sharply after the 30-40 range, with the lowest frequencies observed in the 50 range.](images/outputs/output_8_1.png)
    

We can now import transcriptomic data for the 200 selected genes in the 86 potatoes:

```python
file_data = "https://github.com/sib-swiss/statistics-and-machine-learning-training/raw/refs/heads/main/data/potato_data.transcriptomic.top200norm.csv"
dfTT = pd.read_csv(file_data, index_col=0)
```

We keep only the 73 potatoes:

```python
X = dfTT.loc[i1, :]
```

# Linear regression

Linear regression is one of the most fundamental and widely used techniques in supervised Machine Learning. It is employed to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). The primary goal of linear regression is to fit a linear equation to observed data, enabling predictions and insights into the relationships between variables.

## Approach 1: Simple linear regression

Let's start by fitting a simple linear model with our gene expression values, and see what happens.

We start by importing elements from `sklearn`, a widely used library for Machine Learning in Python:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

> <details-title>About `from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression`</details-title>
>
> With `from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression`, we import the `LinearRegression` class from the `linear_model module` of `scikit-learn`. `LinearRegression` is used to create and train a linear regression model. It fits a linear equation to the observed data, allowing you to make predictions based on the relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target).
> 
{: .details}

We now:
1. Create an instance of the `LinearRegression` class that will be used to fit the linear regression model to our data
2. Train the linear regression model using the training data:
    - `X`: the input feature matrix, where each row represents a sample and each column represents a feature, here a gene and its expression
    - `y`: the target vector, containing the values you want to predict, i.e. the flest color
3. Use the trained linear regression model to make predictions on the same input data `X`

```python
lin_reg = LinearRegression()
lin_reg.fit(X, y)
y_pred = lin_reg.predict(X)
```

The next step is to **evaluate the prediction** using two evaluation metrics from the `metrics` module of `scikit-learn`:
- `r2_score`: This function calculates the R-squared (coefficient of determination) score, which indicates how well the independent variables explain the variance in the dependent variable. An R-squared value of 1 indicates a perfect fit, while a value of 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variance.
- `mean_squared_error`: This function calculates the mean squared error (MSE), which measures the average of the squares of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the observed actual outcomes and the outcomes predicted by the model. Lower values of MSE indicate better model performance.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error
print(f"R-squared score: { r2_score(y ,y_pred ) :.2f}")
print(f"mean squared error: { mean_squared_error(y ,y_pred ) :.2f}")
```

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> 1. What is the value of the R-squared score?
> 2. What is the value of the mean squared error?
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> > 1. `R-squared score: 1.00`
> > 2. `mean squared error: 0.00`
> {: .solution}
>
{: .question}

**Wow!!** this is a perfect fit. But if you know anything about biology, or data analysis, then you likely suspect something wrong is happening.

Back to our potato model. At the moment, our claim is that our model can predict flesh color perfectly (RMSE=0.0) from the normalized expression of these 200 genes. But, say we now have some colleagues who come to us with some new potato data (the leftover data points)

```python
Xnew = dfTT.loc[i2, :]
ynew = df.loc[i2, "Flesh Colour"]
```

We apply the model on the new data

```python
ynew_pred = lin_reg.predict(Xnew)
```

To compare observed values to predicted values, we can generate a scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between observed and predicted values for both training and new data:

```python
plt.scatter(y, y_pred, label="training data")
plt.scatter(ynew, ynew_pred, label="new data")
plt.xlabel("observed values")
plt.ylabel("predicted values")
plt.legend()
```
    
![Scatter plot comparing predicted values to observed values. The x-axis represents observed values ranging from 0 to 60, and the y-axis represents predicted values ranging from -10 to 60. The plot includes two sets of data points: blue dots labeled as 'training data' and orange dots labeled as 'new data.' The blue training data points form a tight cluster along a diagonal line from the bottom-left to the top-right, indicating a strong linear relationship between observed and predicted values. The orange new data points are more scattered around the diagonal line, showing varying degrees of deviation from the perfect prediction line.](images/outputs/output_15_1.png)

As expected, the performance on the new data is not as good as with the data we used to train the model. We have **overfitted** the data.

Here, we could still use the model that we have created, but we would agree that reporting the perfect performance we had with our training data would be misleading. To honestly report the performance of our model, we measure it on a **set of data that has not been used at all to train it: the *test set*.**

To that end, we typically begin by dividing our data into:

* **train** set to find the best model
* **test** set to give an honest evaluation of how the model perform on completely new data.

![Diagram illustrating the division of data into train and test sets. The diagram is divided into two main sections labeled 'train set' and 'test set.' The 'train set' is represented by a larger red rectangle on the left, with an annotation pointing to it that reads 'Finding the data related parameters of a particular model.' The 'test set' is represented by a smaller blue rectangle on the right, with an annotation pointing to it that reads 'Checking the value of our model on unseen data.' Below both rectangles, there is a horizontal line labeled 'DATA,' indicating the entire dataset. The train set is used for training the model, while the test set is used for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.](images/train_test.png)


```python
X_test = Xnew
y_test = ynew
```

## Approach 2: Adding regularization and validation set

In the case of a Least Square fit, the function we are minimizing corresponds to the sum of squared difference between the observation and the predictions of our model:

\\( \sum_i (y_i-f(\pmb X_i,\pmb{\beta}))^2 \\)

with $$y$$ the target vector, $$\pmb X$$ the input feature matrix and $$f$$ our model


**Regularization** is a way to reduce overfitting. In the case of the linear model
we do so by adding to this function a **penalization term which depends on coefficient weights**.
In brief, the stronger the coefficient, the higher the penalization. So only coefficients which bring more fit than penalization will be kept.

The formulas used in `scikit-learn` functions -other libraries may have a different parameterization, but the concepts stay the same- are:

- **L1 regularization** (Lasso): \\(\frac{1}{2n}\sum_i (y_i-f(\pmb X_i,\pmb{\beta}))^2 + \alpha\sum_{j}\lvert\beta_{j}\rvert\\), with  $$\alpha$$ being the weight that you put on that regularization

- **L2 regularization** (Ridge): \\(\sum_i (y_i-f(\pmb X_i,\pmb{\beta}))^2 + \alpha\sum_{j}\beta_{j}^{2}\\)

- **Elastic Net**: \\(\frac{1}{2n}\sum_i (y_i-f(\pmb X_i,\pmb{\beta}))^2 + \alpha\sum_{j}(\rho\lvert\beta_{j}\rvert+\frac{(1-\rho)}{2}\beta_{j}^{2})\\)

Let's try that on our data.

We start by importing the `SGDRegressor` class from the `linear_model` module of the scikit-learn library. SGDRegressor stands for Stochastic Gradient Descent Regressor. It is an implementation of linear regression that uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to fit the model. SGD is an optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters iteratively based on one sample at a time (or a mini-batch of samples), making it efficient for large datasets. It supports various types of regularization (L1, L2, Elastic Net) to prevent overfitting.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor
```

We would like now to perform a grid search over 50 different values -- logarithmically spaced between $$10^{−2}$$ and $$10^2$$ -- of the regularization parameter `alpha` for an SGDRegressor with L1 penalty (Lasso regression). The results will be stored in a DataFrame for further analysis.

```python
%%time

logalphas = []

coef_dict = {
    "name": [],
    "coefficient": [],
    "log-alpha": [],
}
r2 = []

for alpha in np.logspace(-2, 2, 50):

This is great, but how do we choose which level of regularization we want ?

It is a general rule that **as you decrease $$\alpha$$, the $$R^2$$ on the data used for the fit increase**, i.e. you risk overfitting. Consequently, we cannot choose the value of $$\alpha$$ parameter from the data used to fit alone. We call such a parameter an **hyper-parameter**.

{: .question}

In order to find the optimal value of an hyper-parameter, we separate our training data into:
* a **train set** used to fit the model
* a **validation set** used to evaluate how our model perform on new data 

Here we have 73 points. we will use 60 points to train the model and the rest to evaluate the model  

```python
I = list(range(X.shape[0]))
np.random.shuffle( I ) 

I_train = I[:60]
I_valid = I[60:]

X_train = X.iloc[I_train, : ] 
y_train = y.iloc[I_train]

X_valid = X.iloc[I_valid, : ] 
y_valid = y.iloc[I_valid]
```

We now to train the model with 200 `alpha` values logarithmically spaced between $$10^{−3}$$ and $$10^2$$ with L1 penalty (Lasso regression) and make prediction on both the train and validation sets:

```python
logalphas = []

r2_train = []
r2_valid = []

for alpha in np.logspace(-3, 2, 200):
    reg = SGDRegressor(penalty="l1", alpha=alpha)
    reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    logalphas.append(np.log10(alpha))
    r2_train.append(r2_score(y_train, reg.predict(X_train)))
    r2_valid.append(r2_score(y_valid, reg.predict(X_valid)))
```

Let's visualize the $$R^2$$ for both the train and validation sets, as well as the $$\alpha$$ value with highest $$R^2$$ for the validation set:

```python
bestI = np.argmax(r2_valid)
bestLogAlpha = logalphas[bestI]
bestR2_valid = r2_valid[bestI]

fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,5))
fig.suptitle(f"best alpha : {10**bestLogAlpha:.2f} - validation R2 : {bestR2_valid:.2f}")
ax.plot(logalphas, r2_train, label="train set")
ax.plot(logalphas, r2_valid, label="validation set")
ax.scatter([bestLogAlpha], [bestR2_valid], c="red")
ax.set_xlabel("log10( alpha )")
ax.set_ylabel("R2")
ax.set_ylim(-0.1, 1.1)
ax.legend()
```
    
![Line graph showing the relationship between the regularization parameter alpha and the R-squared (R²) scores for both the training set and the validation set. The x-axis is labeled 'log10(alpha)' and ranges from -3 to 2. The y-axis is labeled 'R2' and ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. The graph includes two lines: a blue line representing the R-squared scores for the training set and an orange line representing the R-squared scores for the validation set. The blue line starts high and remains relatively stable for lower values of log10(alpha), then gradually decreases and drops sharply as log10(alpha) increases. The orange line starts low, increases to a peak, and then decreases, with the peak marked by a red dot indicating the best alpha value with a validation R-squared score of 0.65. The title of the graph reads 'best alpha : 0.46 - validation R2 : 0.65'. The legend in the upper right corner distinguishes between the 'train set' and 'validation set' lines.](images/outputs/output_26_2.png)


So now, with the help of the validation set, we can clearly see different phases:
* **Underfitting**: for high $$\alpha$$, the performance is low for both the train and the validation set
* **Overfitting**: for low $$\alpha$$, the performance is high for the train set, and low for the validation set
 
We want the equilibrium point between the two where performance is ideal for the validation set. **But** if we run the code above several time, we will see that the optimal point varies due to the random assignation to train or validation set. 

There exists a myriad of possible strategies to deal with that problem, such as repeating the above many times and taking the average of the results for instance.

> <comment-title></comment-title>
> This problem gets less important as the validation set size increases.
{: .comment}

Anyhow, on top of our earlier regression model, we have added:

* an **hyper-parameter** : $$\alpha$$, the strength of the regularization term
* a **validation strategy** for our model in order to avoid overfitting

That's it, we are now in the world of Machine Learning. But how does the modified model perform on the test data?

![Scatter plot comparing predicted values to observed values. The x-axis is labeled 'observed values' and ranges from 0 to 60. The y-axis is labeled 'predicted values' and ranges from 0 to 60. The plot includes two sets of data points: blue dots labeled as 'training data' and orange dots labeled as 'new data.' The blue training data points form a tight cluster along a diagonal line from the bottom-left to the top-right, indicating a strong linear relationship between observed and predicted values. The orange new data points are more scattered around the diagonal line, showing varying degrees of deviation from the perfect prediction line. The legend in the upper left corner distinguishes between the 'training data' and 'new data' points.](images/outputs/output_29_2.png)

Two things we can observe:
* Still better performance on the train data than on the test data (generally always the case)
* the performance on the test set has improved: our model is less overfit and more generalizable

## Approach 3: k-fold cross-validation

In the previous approach, we have split our training data into a train set and a validation set. This approach works well if you have enough data for your validation set to be representative. Often, we unfortunately do not have enough data for this.

Indeed, we have seen that if we run the code above several time, we see that the optimal point varies due to the random assignation to train or validation set. **k-fold cross validation** is one of the most common strategy to try to mitigate this randomness with a limited amount of data.

![Diagram illustrating the process of cross-validation. The data is divided into a train set and a test set. The train set is further split into multiple folds, with each fold used as a validation set while the remaining folds are used for training. The process is repeated for each fold, and the average score across all folds is calculated to evaluate the model's performance.](images/kfold.png)

In k-fold cross-validation, 
1. Data is split in $$k$$ subpart, called fold. 
2. $$k$$ models are trained for a given hyper-parameter values combination: each time a different fold is used for validation (and the remaining $$k-1$$ folds for training).
3. The average performance is computed across all fold : this is the **cross-validated performance**.

Let's do a simple k-fold manually once (with $$k = 5$$) to explore how it works:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=734)
for i, (train_index, valid_index) in enumerate(kf.split(X)):
    print(f"Fold {i}:")
    print(f" Train: index={train_index}")
    print(f" Test: index={valid_index}")
```

In practice that it is mostly automatized with some of scikit-learn's recipes and objects:
1. Setting up the range of $$\alpha$$ values
2. Setting up k-fold cross-validation as above
3. Looping over $$\alpha$$ values and over each fold in the k-fold cross-validation:
    1. Splits the data into training and validation sets.
    2. Fits the `SGDRegressor` model with the current $$\alpha$$ value on the training set.
    3. Evaluates the model on the validation set using the $$R^{2}$$ score.
    4. Stores the $$R^{2}$$ score for the current fold and updates the average $$R^{2}$$ score across all folds.
4. Finding the best $$\alpha$$ value
     

```python
%%time
logalphas = np.linspace(-2, 1, 200)

kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=6581)

fold_r2s = [[] for i in range(kf.n_splits)] ## for each fold
cross_validated_r2 = [] # average across folds
   
for j,alpha in enumerate( 10**logalphas ) :
    cross_validated_r2.append(0)
    for i, (train_index, valid_index) in enumerate(kf.split(X)):
        ## split train and validation sets
        X_train = X.iloc[train_index, : ]
        X_valid = X.iloc[valid_index, : ]
        y_train = y.iloc[train_index]
        y_valid = y.iloc[valid_index]

        ## fit model for that fold
        reg = SGDRegressor(penalty="l1", alpha = alpha)
        reg.fit(X_train, y_train )

        ## evaluate for that fold
        fold_score = r2_score(y_valid, reg.predict(X_valid))
        
        ## keeping in the curve specific to this fold
        fold_r2s[i].append(fold_score)
        
        ## keeping a tally of the average across folds
        cross_validated_r2[-1] += fold_score/kf.n_splits

bestI = np.argmax(cross_validated_r2)
bestLogAlpha = logalphas[bestI] 
bestR2_valid = cross_validated_r2[bestI]
```

Let's now plot the cross-validated performance of an SGDRegressor model with L1 regularization ($$R^{2}$$) across the different $$\alpha$$ values:

```python
fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,5))

ax.plot(logalphas, cross_validated_r2, label="cross-validated r2")
ax.scatter([bestLogAlpha] , [bestR2_valid], c="red")

for i,scores in enumerate(fold_r2s):
    ax.plot(logalphas, scores, label=f"fold {i}", linestyle="dotted")

ax.set_xlabel("log10( alpha )")
ax.set_ylabel("R2")
ax.set_ylim(-0.1, 1.1)
ax.legend()

fig.suptitle(f"best alpha : {10**bestLogAlpha:.2f} - cross-validated R2 : {bestR2_valid:.2f}")
```

There, you can realize that now, for each possible value of our hyper-parameter we fit and evaluate not 1, but $k$ models, here 4. So, for 200 values of $$\alpha$$, that means $$ 200 x 5 = 1000$$ models to fit and evaluate.

Now, consider that we have other hyper-parameters, such as the type of regularization (L1 or L2), or how we perform scaling, or whether we consider interactions, and now you understand why Machine Learning can quickly become computationnaly intensive. 

## Approach 4: "classical" ML pipeline

Let's start back from scratch to recapitulate what we have seen and use `scikit-learn` to solve the potato problem:

1. Get the full dataset (86 potatoes instead of 73):

   ```python
   X = dfTT
   y = df["Flesh Colour"]
   ```

2. Split our data in a train and a test set using `train_test_split`  from `scikit-learn` with the idea that 20% of the data will be used for testing, and the remaining 80% will be used for training.

   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
   
   print(f"train set size: {len(y_train)}")
   print(f"test set size: {len(y_test)}")
   ```

    > >
    > > test set size: 18

3. Train a model while optimizing some hyper-parameters.

On top of what we've done before, we would like to add a scaling phase and test L1 or L2 penalties. The **scaling phase** is a crucial preprocessing step where the features of your dataset are transformed to a standard scale. This step is important for several reasons: it improves model performance, prevents the dominance of large-range features, and ensures convergence, especially for algorithms that use optimization techniques like gradient descent. Common scaling techniques include standardization (Z-score normalization), which scales the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, and min-max scaling (normalization), which scales the features to a fixed range, usually between 0 and 1.

Scikit-learn's `GridSearchCV` is useful to explore these more "complex" hyper-parameter spaces. Let's see how to set up a machine learning pipeline with scaling and linear regression using `StandardScaler` and `SGDRegressor`, and how to use GridSearchCV to explore different hyperparameter combinations, after that `X_train` and `y_train` have been defined as training features and labels.

1. Create the pipeline with two steps: scaling (set mean of each feature at 0 and (optionally) standard dev at 1 ) and linear regression with regularization

   ```python
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
   from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

   pip_reg = Pipeline([
      ("scaler", StandardScaler()), # Standard scaling step
      ("model", SGDRegressor()),    # Linear regression model with regularization
   ])
   ```

2. Define the hyperparameters and their ranges to be tested

   ```python
   grid_values = {
      "scaler__with_std": [True, False], # Whether to scale to unit variance (standard deviation of 1)
      "model__penalty": ["l1", "l2"], # L1 or L2 regularization
      "model__alpha": np.logspace(-2, 2, 200), # Regularization strength
   }
   ```

    >
    {: .question}

3. Set up `GridSearchCV` with the pipeline, parameter grid (all available CPU cores), scoring metric (i.e. $$R^{2}$$), and cross-validation strategy (i.e. 5-fold)

   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
   grid_reg = GridSearchCV(
      pip_reg, 
      param_grid=grid_values, 
      scoring="r2",
      cv=5,
      n_jobs=-1,
   )
   ```

4. Fit the `GridSearchCV` object to the training data

    The gridSearchCV object will go through each hyperparameter value combination and fit and evaluate each fold, and averages the score across each fold. 
    It then finds the combination that gave the best score and use it to re-train a model with the whole train data

   ```python
   grid_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

5. Get the best cross-validated score

   ```python
   print(f"Grid best score ({grid_reg.scoring}): {grid_reg.best_score_:.3f}")
   print("Grid best parameter :")
   for k,v in grid_reg.best_params_.items():
      print(f" {k:>20} : {v}")
   ```
    
    > <question-title></question-title>

    > > 2. $$\alpha = 6.5173$$ with L2 penalty and scale to unit variance
    > >
    > {: .solution}
    >
    {: .question}

Let's re-fit a model with the best hyperparameter values and check the performance with the *test* data:

```python
reg = grid_reg.best_estimator_

y_pred = reg.predict(X_train)
print(f"train data R-squared score: { r2_score(y_train, y_pred) :.2f}")
print(f"train data mean squared error: { mean_squared_error(y_train, y_pred) :.2f}")

y_test_pred = reg.predict(X_test)

print(f"test data R-squared score: { r2_score(y_test, y_test_pred) :.2f}")
print(f"test data mean squared error: { mean_squared_error(y_test, y_test_pred) :.2f}")

plt.scatter(y_train, y_pred, label="training data")
plt.scatter(y_test, y_test_pred, label="new data")
plt.xlabel("observed values")
plt.ylabel("predicted values")
plt.legend()
```

We have explored the fundamentals of linear regression, including how to fit models, evaluate their performance, and interpret coefficients, it's time to shift our focus to another essential technique in Machine Learning: logistic regression.

# Logistic regression

## Simple case

Let's imagine a simple case with 2 groups, and a single feature:

```python
X1 = np.concatenate([np.random.randn(300), np.random.randn(300)+4])
y = np.array([0]*300 + [1]*300)

sns.histplot(x=X1, hue=y)
```
    
![Histogram comparing the distribution of two categories labeled as '0' and '1'. The x-axis represents the range of values, approximately from -3 to 7, and the y-axis represents the count of occurrences, ranging from 0 to 100. The histogram consists of two sets of bars: blue bars representing category '0' and orange bars representing category '1'. The blue bars are predominantly clustered around the value 0, with counts reaching up to approximately 90. The orange bars are predominantly clustered around the value 4, with counts also reaching up to approximately 90. There is some overlap between the two distributions, particularly around the value 2. The legend in the upper right corner distinguishes between the '0' and '1' categories](images/outputs/output_51_1.png)
    
We will use a **logistic regressio**n to model the relationship between the class and the feature. While linear regression is used for predicting continuous outcomes, logistic regression is specifically designed for classification problems, where the goal is to predict categorical outcomes. **Logistic regression does not model the class directly, but rather model the class probabilities** (through the logit transform).

Let's see how effect of different regularization strengths (alpha values) on the class probabilities predicted by a logistic regression model:

1. Scale the feature data `X1` using `StandardScaler` to ensure that the data has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Scaling is important for logistic regression to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model.

   ```python
   X1_norm = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X1.reshape(X1.shape[0], 1))
   ```

2. Loop over $$\alpha$$ values to
    - Initialize and fit a `LogisticRegression` model with L2 penalty to the scaled data.
    - Calculate and plot the predicted probabilities for class 1 over a range of values from -2 to 2.

   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

   fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,5))

   ax.scatter(X1_norm, y, c=y)

   for alpha in [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]:
      # this implementation does not take alpha but rather C = 1/alpha
      C = 1/alpha
      lr = LogisticRegression(penalty="l2", C=C)
      lr.fit(X1_norm, y)
      proba = lr.predict_proba(np.linspace(-2, 2, 100).reshape(-1, 1))
      ax.plot(np.linspace(-2, 2, 100), proba[:,1], label=f"alpha = {alpha}")
   ax.legend()
   ```


![Line plot showing the effect of different regularization strengths (alpha values) on the class probabilities predicted by a logistic regression model. The x-axis ranges from -2 to 2, and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 1, representing the predicted probability of class 1. The plot includes four lines, each representing a different alpha value: a blue line for alpha = 0.01, an orange line for alpha = 0.1, a green line for alpha = 1, and a red line for alpha = 10. Additionally, there are scatter points colored in yellow and purple, representing the data points for two different classes. The lines show how the predicted probabilities change with varying alpha values, with higher alpha values (stronger regularization) resulting in smoother and less extreme probability curves. The legend in the upper left corner distinguishes between the different alpha values](images/outputs/output_53_1.png)
    
We can see that **when $$\alpha$$ grows, the probabilities evolve more smoothly**, i.e. we have more regularization. However, note that all the curves meet at the same point, corresponding to the 0.5 probability. This is nice, but **our end-goal is to actually be able to predict the classes**, and not just the probabilities. 

Our task is not regression anymore, but rather **classification**. So here, we should not evaluate the model using $$R^2$$ or log-likelihood, but a classification metric.

Let's begin by the most common: **Accuracy**, i.e. the proportion of samples which were correctly classified (as either category):

$$Accuracy = \frac{TP + TN}{TP+FP+FN+TN}$$ 

with
* TP: True Positive
* FP: False Positive
* TN: True Negative
* FN: False Negative

![visual representation of True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, and False Negative](images/TPFP.png "Image credit wikipedia user Sharpr for svg version. original work by kakau in a png. Licensed under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en">Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license</a>")

Accuracy forces us to make a choice about the **probability threshold we use predict categories**. 0.5 is a common choice, and the default of the `predict` method:


```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
y_predicted = lr.predict(X1_norm)

print(f"Accuracy with a threshold of 0.5 : {accuracy_score(y, y_predicted):.2f}"  )
```

```

But it can be useful to remember that this is only 1 choice among many:

```python
y_predicted
```

In logistic regression, the default decision threshold is 0.5, but we can adjust it the accuracy.

```python
threshold = 0.2
y_predicted = lr.predict_proba(X1_norm)[:, 1] > threshold
print(f"Accuracy with a threshold of {threshold} : {accuracy_score(y,y_predicted):.2f}")
pd.crosstab(y, y_predicted, rownames=["observed"], colnames=["predicted"])
```

When the threshold of 0.2, the accuracy is 0.92. The cross-tabulation is:

| predicted | 0 | 1 |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| observed |  |  |
| 0 | 254 | 46 |
| 1 | 0 | 300 |

Here, all these covariables / features are defined on very different scales, for them to be treated fairly in their comparison you need to take that into account by scaling.

From there we can explore the model a bit further. We can access the coefficient of the model and sort them to assess their importance:

```python
w_lr_cancer = grid_cancer.best_estimator_["model"].coef_[0]

sorted_features = sorted(
    zip(breast_cancer_df.columns, w_lr_cancer),
    key=lambda x : np.abs(x[1]), # sort by absolute value

)

Let's now predict the results on the test data:

```python
y_cancer_test_pred = grid_cancer.predict(X_test_cancer)
```

The Confusion Matrix is a table to visualize and evaluate the performance of the classification model. It's a powerful tool for understanding how well our model is doing, where it's going wrong, and what we can do to improve it. It shows the number of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN) in our classification results:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix
confusion_m_cancer = confusion_matrix(y_test_cancer, y_cancer_test_pred)

plt.figure(figsize=(5,4))
sns.heatmap(confusion_m_cancer, annot=True)
plt.title(f"Accuracy:{accuracy_score(y_test_cancer,y_cancer_test_pred):.3f}")
plt.ylabel("True label")
plt.xlabel("Predicted label")
```
    
![A confusion matrix showing the number of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN) in a classification model. The matrix has four quadrants, with TP in the top-left, FN in the top-right, FP in the bottom-left, and TN in the bottom-right.](images/outputs/output_73_1.png)
    
With its default threshold of 0.5, this model tends to produce more False Positive, i.e. benign cancer seen as malignant, than False Negative, i.e. malignant cancer seen as benign. Depending on the particular of the problem we are trying to solve, that may be a desirable outcome.

Whatever the case, it is always interesting to explore a bit more. We will plot how each possible threshold affect the **True Positive Rate** (TPR) and the **False Positive Rate** (FPR): the **Receiver Operating Characteristic curve** (**ROC curve**).

1. With `predict_proba`, we get the predicted probabilities for each class for the test data. We focus on the probability of being of the positive class (class 1), i.e. malignant, so we keep only the second column

   ```python
   y_proba_lr_cancer = grid_cancer.predict_proba(X_test_cancer)[:, 1]
   ```

   In logistic regression, the model outputs a score known as the **logit**, which is the natural logarithm of the odds of the positive class. The logit is a linear combination of the input features and the model coefficients. To interpret these logits as probabilities, we need to convert them back to the probability scale using the sigmoid function, also known as the **expit function**.

   ```python
   from scipy.special import expit
   y_proba_lr_cancer = expit(y_score_lr_cancer)
   ```

   > <details-title>Logit and expit</details-title>

   >
   > This conversion ensures that the output is a valid probability, i.e., a value between 0 and 1.
   {: .details}

2. We calculates now the ROC curve with TPR and FPR for each threshold of score

   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve
   
   fpr_lr_cancer, tpr_lr_cancer, threshold_cancer = roc_curve(
       y_test_cancer, y_proba_lr_cancer
   )
   ```

3. We find the point corresponding to a 0.5 theshold:
   
   ```python
   keep = np.argmin(np.abs(threshold_cancer - 0.5))
   ```

4. We compute the area under the ROC curve (**AUC**):

   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import auc
   roc_auc_lr_cancer = auc(fpr_lr_cancer, tpr_lr_cancer)
   ```

   > <details-title>Area Under the Curve (AUC)</details-title>
   >
   > AUC is a widely used metric for evaluating the performance of classification models, particularly in the context of binary classification.
   > The AUC is calculated as the area under the ROC curve. It ranges from 0 to 1. A model with no discrimination ability (random guessing) has an AUC of 0.5. A perfect model has an AUC of 1.
   > 
   > Why is AUC Important?
   > 
   > - **Threshold-Independent**: AUC provides a single scalar value that summarizes the performance of the classifier across all possible thresholds. This makes it a threshold-independent metric.
   > - **Discrimination Ability**: AUC measures the ability of the model to discriminate between positive and negative classes. A higher AUC indicates better model performance.
   > - **Comparative Metric**: AUC is useful for comparing the performance of different models or different configurations of the same model.
   >
   > 
   {: .details}

3. We plot the ROC, TPR, and FPR:

   ```python
   plt.figure()
   plt.xlim([-0.01, 1.01])
   plt.ylim([-0.01, 1.01])
   plt.plot(
       fpr_lr_cancer,
       tpr_lr_cancer,
       lw=3,
       label=f"LogRegr ROC curve\n (area = {roc_auc_lr_cancer:0.2f})"
   )
   plt.plot(fpr_lr_cancer[keep], tpr_lr_cancer[keep], "ro", label="threshold=0.5")
   plt.xlabel("False Positive Rate", fontsize=16)
   plt.ylabel("True Positive Rate", fontsize=16)
   plt.title("ROC curve (logistic classifier)", fontsize=16)
   plt.legend(loc="lower right", fontsize=13)
   plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color="navy", lw=3, linestyle="--")
   plt.show()
   ```
    
![ROC curve plot for a logistic classifier. The x-axis is labeled 'False Positive Rate' and ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. The y-axis is labeled 'True Positive Rate' and ranges from 0.0 to 1.0.

A red dot on the curve marks the point corresponding to a threshold of 0.5. A dashed diagonal line runs from the bottom-left to the top-right, representing the line of no discrimination (random guessing). The legend in the bottom right corner distinguishes between the 'LogRegr ROC curve (area = 0.98)' and the 'threshold=0.5' point.](images/outputs/output_75_0.png)

So with this ROC curve, we can see how the model would behave on different thresholds.

For now, let's put this aside briefly to explore a very common problem in classification: imbalance.


## Imbalanced dataset

Let's use the same small example as before, but now instead of 300 sample of each class, imagine we only have 30 samples of class 1:

```python
X1 = np.concatenate([np.random.randn(300), np.random.randn(30)+2])
y = np.array([0]*300 + [1]*30)

# do not forget to scale the data
X1_norm = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X1.reshape(X1.shape[0], 1 ))

fig,ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14,5))

sns.histplot(x=X1, hue=y, ax=ax[0])

ax[1].scatter(X1_norm, y, c=y)

for alpha in [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]:
    # this implementation does not take alpham but rather C = 1/alpha
    C = 1/alpha
    lr = LogisticRegression(penalty="l2", C=C)
    lr.fit(X1_norm, y)
    
    proba = lr.predict_proba(np.linspace(-2, 3, 100).reshape(-1, 1))
    ax[1].plot(np.linspace(-2, 3, 100), proba[:,1], label=f"alpha = {alpha}")
ax[1].legend()
```
    
![Left Plot: Histogram showing the distribution of data points for two classes labeled as '0' and '1'. The x-axis ranges from approximately -3 to 4, and the y-axis represents the count of occurrences, ranging from 0 to 50. The histogram consists of blue bars representing class '0' and orange bars representing class '1'. The blue bars are predominantly clustered around the value 0, with counts reaching up to approximately 50. The orange bars are predominantly clustered around the value 2, with counts reaching up to approximately 10. The legend in the upper right corner distinguishes between the '0' and '1' classes. Right Plot: Line plot showing the effect of different regularization strengths (alpha values) on the class probabilities predicted by a logistic regression model.

The plot includes four lines, each representing a different alpha value: a blue line for alpha = 0.01, an orange line for alpha = 0.1, a green line for alpha = 1, and a red line for alpha = 10. Additionally, there are scatter points colored in yellow and purple, representing the data points for two different classes. The lines show how the predicted probabilities change with varying alpha values, with higher alpha values (stronger regularization) resulting in smoother and less extreme probability curves. The legend in the upper left corner distinguishes between the different alpha values](images/outputs/output_79_1.png)


The point where the probability curves for different alpha converge is not 0.5 anymore. And the probability says fairly low even at the right end of the plot.


```python
y_predicted = lr.predict(X1_norm)

Most sample of the class 1 samples are miss-classified (24/30), but we still get a very high accuracy. That is because, by contruction, both the **logistic regression and accuracy score do not differentiate False Positive and False Negative**.

And the problem gets worse the more imbalance there is.


```python
from sklearn.metrics import recall_score

recall_list = [] # TP / (TP + FN)
acc_list = []

imbalance_list = np.linspace(0, 1, 50)

alpha = 1
for imbalance in imbalance_list:
    n0 = 300
    n1 = int(n0 * (1 - imbalance))
    if n1 == 0:
        n1 = 1
    
    X1 = np.concatenate([np.random.randn(n0), np.random.randn(n1)+2])
    y = np.array([0]*n0 + [1]*n1)

    X1_norm = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X1.reshape(X1.shape[0], 1))
    
    C = 1/alpha
    lr = LogisticRegression(penalty = "l2", C = C)
    lr.fit(X1_norm , y)
    
    y_predicted = lr.predict(X1_norm)
    
    recall_list.append(recall_score(y, y_predicted))
    acc_list.append(accuracy_score(y, y_predicted))
        
fig,ax=plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 4))
ax.plot(imbalance_list, acc_list, label="accuracy")
ax.plot(imbalance_list, recall_list, label="recall")
ax.set_xlabel("imbalance")
ax.legend()
```
    
![Line plot showing the relationship between class imbalance and two performance metrics: accuracy and recall. The x-axis is labeled 'imbalance' and ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, representing the proportion of the minority class in the dataset. The y-axis ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, representing the values of the performance metrics. The plot includes two lines: a blue line representing accuracy and an orange line representing recall. The blue accuracy line remains relatively stable and high across different levels of imbalance, fluctuating slightly around 0.8 to 0.9. The orange recall line starts high but gradually decreases as the imbalance increases, showing more significant fluctuations and a sharp drop as the imbalance approaches 1.0. The legend in the bottom left corner distinguishes between the 'accuracy' and 'recall' lines.](images/outputs/output_83_1.png)
    
Not only does the precision get worse, the **accuracy actually gets higher as there is more imbalance!**

This can lead to several issues:
* **Model Bias**: imbalance in the dataset skews the **logistic regression** toward predicting the majority class more frequently. This is because the model aims to minimize the overall error, and predicting the majority class more often results in fewer errors. As a result, the model may perform poorly on the minority class, leading to low recall and precision for that class.
* **Metric Limitations:** **accuracy** does not differenciate between False Positive and False Negative, making it **blind to imbalance**. Indeed, a model that predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy but fail to identify the minority class.

To address these issues, the solutions will have to tackle both the model and the evaluation metric.

1. **For the logistic regression** - **Re-weighting Samples**: One effective approach is to re-weight the samples according to their class frequency during the model fitting process. This ensures that the minority class instances are given more importance, helping the model to learn better from the imbalanced data.

    In `scikit-learn`, this can be achieved using the `class_weight` parameter in the `LogisticRegression` class. Setting `class_weight="balanced"` automatically adjusts the weights inversely proportional to the class frequencies.

2. **For the metric**, there exists several metrics which are sensitive to imbalance problems. Here we will introduce the **[balanced accuracy](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#balanced-accuracy-score)**, a metric that accounts for class imbalance by calculating the average of the recall (true positive rate) for each class:

    $$balanced_accuracy = 0.5*( \frac{TP}{TP+FN} + \frac{TN}{TN+FP} )$$

Let's see the impact of re-weighting samples and using balanced accuracy:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import balanced_accuracy_score


def check_imbalance_effect(imbalance_list, class_weight = None):
    recall_list = []
    balanced_acc_list = []
    acc_list = []
    for imbalance in imbalance_list:
        n0 = 300
        n1 = int(n0 * (1 - imbalance))
        if n1 == 0:
            n1 = 1

        X1 = np.concatenate([np.random.randn(n0), np.random.randn(n1)+2])
        y = np.array([0]*n0 + [1]*n1)

        X1_norm = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X1.reshape(X1.shape[0], 1))

        # LR
        lr = LogisticRegression(penalty="l2", C=1, class_weight=class_weight)
        lr.fit(X1_norm, y)

        y_predicted = lr.predict(X1_norm)

        recall_list.append(recall_score(y , y_predicted))
        acc_list.append(accuracy_score(y, y_predicted))
        balanced_acc_list.append(balanced_accuracy_score(y, y_predicted))

    return recall_list, acc_list, balanced_acc_list


imbalance_list = np.linspace(0, 1, 50)

recall_list, acc_list, balanced_acc_list = check_imbalance_effect(
    imbalance_list,
    class_weight=None,
)

fig,ax=plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 4))
ax[0].plot(imbalance_list, acc_list, label="accuracy - class_weight=None")
ax[0].plot(imbalance_list, recall_list, label="recall - class_weight=None")
ax[0].plot(
    imbalance_list,
    balanced_acc_list,
    label="balanced_accuracy - class_weight=None",
)
ax[0].set_xlabel("imbalance")
ax[0].set_ylim(0, 1)
ax[0].legend()
## now, with class weight 

recall_list, acc_list, balanced_acc_list = check_imbalance_effect(
    imbalance_list,
    class_weight="balanced"
)
            
ax[1].plot(imbalance_list, acc_list, label="accuracy - class_weight=balanced" )
ax[1].plot(imbalance_list, recall_list, label="recall - class_weight=balanced" )
ax[1].plot(
    imbalance_list,
    balanced_acc_list,
    label="balanced_accuracy - class_weight=balanced",
)
ax[1].set_xlabel("imbalance")
ax[1].set_ylim(0, 1)
ax[1].legend()
```

The **balanced accuracy** is able to detect an imbalance problem and setting `class_weight="balanced"` in our logistic regression fixes the imbalance at the level of the model.

# Decision tree modeling

Having explored the intricacies of logistic regression, including techniques to handle class imbalance and evaluate model performance using metrics like balanced accuracy, we now turn our attention to another powerful and versatile machine learning algorithm: **decision trees**. While logistic regression is a linear model that is well-suited for binary classification problems, decision trees offer a different approach, capable of capturing complex, non-linear relationships in the data: **a (new?) loss function and new ways to do regularization**. Decision trees are particularly useful for their interpretability and ability to **handle both classification and regression tasks**, making them a valuable tool in the machine learning toolkit.

By understanding decision trees and their regularization techniques, we will gain insights into how to build models that can capture intricate patterns in the data while avoiding overfitting. Let's dive into the world of decision tree modeling and discover how this algorithm can be applied to a wide range of predictive tasks.

## Simple decision tree for classification

A **decision tree** is a powerful and intuitive machine learning algorithm that breaks down complex problems into a **hierarchical sequence of simpler questions**. This process subdivides the data into increasingly specific subgroups, each defined by the answers to these questions. Here's how it works:

1. **Hierarchical Structure**:
    - A decision tree starts with a single node, known as the **root** node, which represents the entire dataset.
    - From the root, the tree branches out into a series of internal nodes, each representing a question or decision based on the features of the data.

2. **Binary Splits**:
    - At each internal node, the decision tree asks a yes-or-no question about a feature. The answer to this question determines which branch to follow next.
    - This binary split divides the data into two subgroups: one where the condition is met (yes) and another where it is not (no).

3. **Recursive Partitioning**:
    - The process of asking questions and splitting the data continues recursively for each subgroup. Each new question further subdivides the data into more specific subgroups.
    - This recursive partitioning continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum tree depth, a minimum number of samples per node, or pure leaf nodes where all samples belong to the same class.

4. **Leaf Nodes**:
    - The final nodes in the tree, known as **leaf** nodes, represent the outcomes or predictions for the subgroups of data.
    - In classification tasks, leaf nodes assign a class label to the samples in that subgroup. In regression tasks, leaf nodes provide a predicted value.

![Left Diagram: Diagram illustrating the structure of a decision tree. The tree starts with a root node labeled as 'Decision Node.' From the root node, the tree branches out into two sub-trees, each starting with a decision node. These decision nodes further branch into leaf nodes, which are the terminal nodes of the tree. The diagram highlights the hierarchical nature of decision trees, where each decision node represents a question or decision based on the features of the data, and each leaf node represents the outcome or prediction for the subgroup of data. The root node, decision nodes, and leaf nodes are color-coded for clarity, with the root node in green, decision nodes in blue, and leaf nodes in red. Right Diagram: Diagram showing an example of a decision tree used to determine whether a job offer is accepted or declined. The tree starts with a root node asking the question, 'Is the salary between $50,000 and $80,000?' Depending on the answer, the tree branches into two paths: (1) If 'Yes,' the next question is, 'Is the office near to home?'(1.1) If 'Yes,' the next question is, 'Does the company provide a cab facility?' (1.1.1) If 'Yes,' the outcome is 'Accepted offer.' (1.1.2) If 'No,' the outcome is 'Declined offer.' (1.2) If 'No,' the outcome is 'Declined offer.' (2) If 'No,' the outcome is 'Declined offer.' The diagram uses yellow boxes for decision nodes, green ovals for outcomes, and red text for the questions asked at each decision node. This example illustrates how a decision tree makes a series of yes-or-no decisions to arrive at a final prediction."](images/tree_ex.png)

A huge number of trees can actually be built just by considering the different orders of questions asked. How does the algorithm deals with this? Quite simply actually: it **tests all the features and chooses the most discriminative** (with respect to your target variable), i.e. the feature where a yes or no question divides the data into 2 subsets which minimizes an **impurity measure**.

Let's imagine we have a dataset with feature color (red or blue), feature shape (square or circle), and 2 target classes (1 and 2):

![Diagram illustrating the classification of objects based on two features: color and shape. The top section shows two classes, Class 1 and Class 2, each represented by a series of shapes that are either red or blue and either squares or circles. The features are described as follows: "Color: red or blue" and "Shape: square or circle". Below the feature descriptions, there are two decision trees. Left Decision Tree: The root node asks the question: 'Is the color red?' If 'True,' the branch leads to a leaf node with the counts: 'Class 1: 10, Class 2: 1.' If 'False,' the branch leads to a leaf node with the counts: 'Class 1: 2, Class 2: 11.' The caption below this tree states: 'Those groups are highly skewed toward certain class.' Right Decision Tree:  The root node asks the question: 'Is the shape square?' If 'True,' the branch leads to a leaf node with the counts: 'Class 1: 5, Class 2: 7.' If 'False,' the branch leads to a leaf node with the counts: 'Class 1: 7, Class 2: 5.' The caption below this tree states: 'Those groups are well mixed.](images/Tree.png)


If we ask whether the feature "color is red," we get the following subgroups:

- 10 instances of Class 1 and 1 instance of Class 2 (`if "feature color is red" == True`)
- 2 instances of Class 1 and 11 instances of Class 2 (`if "feature color is red" == False`)

Asking whether the "feature shape is square" gives us:

- 5 instances of Class 1 and 7 instances of Class 2 (if True)
- 7 instances of Class 1 and 5 instances of Class 2 (if False)

We will prefer asking "feature color is red?" over "feature shape is square?" because "feature color is red?" is more discriminative.


For **categorical variables**, the questions test for a specific category. For **numerical variables**, the questions use a threshold as a yes/no question. The threshold is chosen to **minimize impurity**. The best threshold for a variable is used to estimate its discriminativeness.

Of course, we will need to compute this threshold at each step of our tree since, at each step, we are considering different subsets of the data.

The **impurity is related to how much our feature splitting is still having mixed classes**. Impurity provides a score that indicates the purity of the split. Common measures of impurity include **Shannon entropy** and the **Gini coefficient**.

- [**Shannon Entropy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)): \\( \text{Entropy} = - \sum_{j} p_j \log_2(p_j) \\)

  This measure is linked to information theory, where the information of an event occurring is the \\( \log_2 \\) of the event's probability of occurring. For purity, **0 is the best possible score, and higher values are worse**.

- [**Gini Coefficient**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient): \\( \text{Gini} = 1 - \sum_{j} p_j^2 \\)

  The idea is to measure the **probability that a dummy classifier mislabels your data**. **0 is best, and higher values are worse**.

### Toy dataset

To see how both work in practice, let's generate some toy data: a synthetic dataset with 250 samples distributed among three clusters. Each cluster has a specified center and standard deviation, which determine the location and spread of the data points.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
 
blob_centers = np.array([[-7, 2.5], [6, -10], [8, -3]])
blob_stds = [[1, 3], [3, 6], [3, 6]]
X_3, y_3 = make_blobs(
    n_samples=250,
    centers=blob_centers,
    cluster_std=blob_stds,
    random_state=42
)

plt.scatter(X_3[:, 0], X_3[:, 1], c=y_3, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm, edgecolors="k")
```

![Scatter plot displaying three distinct clusters of data points. The x-axis ranges from approximately -10 to 15, and the y-axis ranges from approximately -20 to 10. The plot contains three groups of data points, each represented by different colors and markers. A cluster of blue filled circles located in the upper left quadrant, centered around the coordinates (-7, 2.5). A cluster of red filled circles located in the lower right quadrant, centered around the coordinates (6, -10). A cluster of gray open circles scattered around the coordinates (8, -3). The blue cluster is densely packed, while the red and gray clusters are more spread out and overlap slightly. The plot visually represents the distribution and separation of the three clusters in a two-dimensional feature space](images/outputs/output_94_1.png)

We will now create a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 3 and fits the decision tree classifier to the training data `X_3` (features) and `y_3` (target labels):

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)
tree.fit(X_3, y_3)
```

Let's look at the cross-tabulation:

```python
pd.crosstab(tree.predict(X_3), y_3, rownames=["truth"], colnames=["prediction"])
```

We can also plot the decision tree:

```python
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree
fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(14, 6))

_ = plot_tree(
    tree,
    feature_names=["x", "y"] , 
    fontsize=14,
    filled=True,
    impurity=False,
    precision=3,
    ax=ax,
)
```

![Decision tree diagram illustrating the classification process based on two features, x and y. The tree starts with a root node that splits based on the condition x≤−4.419x≤−4.419, with 250 samples and a value distribution of [84, 83, 83]. The left branch (true) leads to a node with 84 samples, all classified as [84, 0, 0]. The right branch (false) leads to a node with the condition y≤−4.769y≤−4.769, containing 166 samples with a value distribution of [0, 83, 83]. This node further splits into two branches: the left branch (true) with the condition y≤11.698y≤11.698, containing 105 samples with a value distribution of [0, 73, 32], which splits into nodes with 35 samples [0, 32, 3] and 70 samples [0, 41, 29]; the right branch (false) with the condition y≤−3.056y≤−3.056, containing 61 samples with a value distribution of [0, 10, 51], which splits into nodes with 17 samples [0, 6, 11] and 44 samples [0, 4, 40]. The diagram visually represents the decision-making process of the tree, showing how the data is split based on the feature thresholds and the resulting class distributions at each node.](images/outputs/output_97_0.png)

For the decision tree classifier, there are many parameters, but we will explore some of the main ones. For that, we defines functions to create a mesh grid for plotting and to visualize the decision boundaries of decision tree:


```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

def make_meshgrid(x, y, n=100):
    x_min, x_max = x.min() - 1, x.max() + 1
    y_min, y_max = y.min() - 1, y.max() + 1
    xx, yy = np.meshgrid(
        np.linspace(x_min, x_max, n),
        np.linspace(y_min, y_max, n),
    )
    return xx, yy


def contour_tree(X, y, n_estimators=1, **kwargs):
    if n_estimators==1:
        model = DecisionTreeClassifier(**kwargs)
    else:
        model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=n_estimators, **kwargs)
    
    model = model.fit(X, y) 

    title = "Decision tree " + " ".join([f"{k}:{v}" for k, v in kwargs.items()])

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(15, 8))
    X0, X1 = X[:, 0], X[:, 1]
    xx, yy = make_meshgrid(X0, X1)
    Z = model.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()]).reshape(xx.shape)
    ax[0].contourf(xx, yy, Z, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm, alpha=0.8)
    ax[0].scatter(X0, X1, c=y, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm, s=20, edgecolors="k")
    ax[0].set_xlim(xx.min(), xx.max())
    ax[0].set_ylim(yy.min(), yy.max())
    ax[0].set_title(title)
        
    if n_estimators == 1:
        _ = plot_tree(
            model,
            feature_names=["x", "y"] , 
            fontsize=10,
            filled=True,
            impurity=False,
            precision=3,
            ax=ax[1],
        )
    plt.show()
    return
```

With default values:

```python
contour_tree(X_3, y_3)
```
    
![The image consists of two main parts: a decision boundary plot on the left and a decision tree diagram on the right. The decision boundary plot, titled 'Decision tree,' shows a 2D feature space with regions colored in blue, red, and light blue, representing different class predictions. Data points are scattered across the plot, with blue, red, and gray circles indicating their true class labels. The decision boundaries are depicted as horizontal and vertical lines, segmenting the feature space. The decision tree diagram starts with a root node that splits based on the condition x≤−4.419x≤−4.419 with 250 samples and a value distribution of [84, 83, 83].

This node further splits into branches with conditions y <= −11.698 and y <= −3.056, each containing sub-nodes with specific sample counts and value distributions, illustrating the decision-making process of the tree.](images/outputs/output_100_0.png)

With the default values, the decision tree is really complex with many recursive levels. Let's look how to modify it.

- **Max Tree Depth** (`max_depth`): The maximum number of consecutive questions (splits) the tree can ask. This limits the depth of the tree to prevent overfitting.

   ```python
   contour_tree(X_3, y_3, max_depth=2)
   ```
    
   ![The image consists of two main parts: a decision boundary plot on the left and a decision tree diagram on the right.

This node further splits into two branches: the left branch with 105 samples and value [0, 73, 32], and the right branch with 61 samples and value [0, 10, 51], illustrating the decision-making process of the tree.](images/outputs/output_101_0.png)

- **Min Splitting of Leaves** (`min_samples_leaf`): The minimum number of data points required for a node to be considered a leaf. This ensures that leaf nodes have enough data points to make a reliable prediction.


   ```python
   contour_tree(X_3, y_3, min_samples_leaf=20)
   ```
    
   ![The image consists of two main parts: a decision boundary plot on the left and a decision tree diagram on the right.

- **Min Splitting of Nodes** (`min_samples_split`): The minimum number of data points required to consider splitting a node into further branches. This ensures that a node has sufficient data before creating a new rule.


   ```python
   contour_tree(X_3, y_3, min_samples_split=20)
   ```
    
   ![The image consists of two main parts: a decision boundary plot on the left and a decision tree diagram on the right.

There are 3 main advantages to these methods:
* They work with all types of features
* We don’t need to rescale the data.
* They already include non-linear fitting.

Moreover **they are relatively to interpret.**

However, even with all these hyperparameters, they are still not great on new data (inaccuracy). 

### Single decision tree pipeline on real data

   }
   
   grid_tree = GridSearchCV(
       DecisionTreeClassifier(class_weight="balanced"), 
       param_grid=grid_values,
       scoring="roc_auc",

   )
   grid_tree.fit(X_train_cancer, y_train_cancer)
   
   print(f"Grid best score (accuracy): {grid_tree.best_score_:.3f}")
   print("Grid best parameter :")
   
   for k,v in grid_tree.best_params_.items():

3. Sorts features per importance in discriminative process

   Trees do not have coefficients like the logistic regression, but they still have a feature importance metric which is computed from how much each feature reduce impurity.

   sorted_features=sorted(
       [[breast_cancer_df.columns[i], abs(w_tree[i])] for i in range(len(w_tree))],
       key=lambda x : x[1],
       reverse=True,
   )
   
   print("Features sorted per importance in discriminative process")
   for f,w in sorted_features:

   fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(25, 10))

       precision=3,
   )
   ax.set_title("best single decision tree")
   ```

   ![The image is a decision tree diagram titled 'best single decision tree.' The root node splits based on the condition 'mean concave points <= 0.049' with 213 samples and a value range of [213.0, 213.0]. The left branch (true) leads to a node with the condition 'mean area <= 606.25' containing 267 samples and a value range of [199.438, 20.694]. This node further splits into two branches: the left branch with the condition 'mean concave points <= 0.031' containing 3 samples and a value range of [194.652, 6.038], and the right branch with the condition 'mean texture <= 16.19' containing 10 samples and a value range of [4.787, 12.057].

A simple decision tree is a powerful and intuitive tool for classification tasks. It works by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on the values of input features, aiming to create branches that lead to pure nodes containing instances of a single class. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both numerical and categorical data without the need for rescaling. They also inherently include non-linear fitting, making them versatile for a wide range of problems.

However, decision trees can suffer from overfitting, especially when the tree becomes too deep and captures noise in the training data. This can lead to poor generalization on new, unseen data. Additionally, decision trees can be sensitive to the specific subset of data they are trained on, which can result in unstable predictions. To address the limitations of simple decision trees, we can use an ensemble method called Random Forests.

## Random Forests for classification

The Random Forest algorithm relies on two main concepts:

- **Randomly** producing and training **a collection (or "forest") of decision trees**, where each tree is trained on a different subset of the data and uses a random subset of features for splitting.
- **Aggregating** the predictions of all these trees, primarily through averaging.

The randomness between trees involves:

- Bootstrapping the training dataset.

    **Bootstrapping** is a sampling method where we randomly draw a subsample from our data with replacement. The created replicate is the same size as the original dataset. This process helps improve the generalization of the model by introducing variability in the training data for each tree.

    ![The image illustrates the process of a random forest classifier, which combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance. At the top, the process begins with a data set bootstrap for each tree, where different subsets of the data are randomly selected with replacement. This is followed by features random sampling for each tree, where a random subset of features is selected for splitting at each node. The image shows three decision trees: the first tree (gray) has nodes splitting based on different features, the second tree (yellow) follows a similar structure, and the third tree (purple) also splits based on randomly selected features. Below each tree, the probabilities for a sample to belong to class 1 are shown, with varying percentages indicating the confidence of each tree's prediction. The final prediction is made by averaging the votes from all trees, resulting in a more robust and accurate classification. For examp](images/RF.png)

- Using only a random subset of features.


Intuitively, we can see how this approach enhances the model's ability to generalize. By aggregating the predictions of many trees, Random Forests reduce the risk of overfitting and provide more stable and accurate predictions. This ensemble approach leverages the strengths of individual decision trees while mitigating their weaknesses, resulting in a more reliable and generalizable model

In addition to the parameters used to create each individual tree in the forest, we also have a parameter controlling the number of trees in your forest.

In the following plots, we will plot the result for a random forest algorithm on the toy dataset above and compare it to a single decision tree sharing the same hyperparameters value than the one used in the random forest:

- Single tree

   ![The image consists of two main parts: a decision boundary plot on the left and a decision tree diagram on the right. The decision boundary plot, titled 'Decision tree max_depth:3 min_samples_leaf:10,' shows a 2D feature space with regions colored in blue, red, and light blue, representing different class predictions. Data points are scattered across the plot, with blue, red, and gray circles indicating their true class labels. The decision boundaries are depicted as horizontal and vertical lines, segmenting the feature space. The decision tree diagram starts with a root node that splits based on the condition x <= −4.419 with 250 samples and a value distribution of [84, 83, 83].

## Random Forest in regression

Transitioning from classification to regression, the fundamental concept of Random Forests remains consistent, but the criteria for decision-making at each node shift. In classification, metrics like entropy or the Gini index are used to determine which variable to split on at each node. However, in regression, this decision is made using a regression-specific metric, such as the mean squared error (MSE).

### Toy random dataset

For example, consider this example of [regression with a single tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/tree/plot_tree_regression.html), adapted from the scikit-learn website, in which we:

1. Create a random dataset
2. Fit regression model
3. Predict
4. Plot the results

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

# Create a random dataset
rng = np.random.RandomState(1)
X = np.sort(5 * rng.rand(80, 1), axis=0)
y = np.sin(X).ravel()
y[::5] += 3 * (0.5 - rng.rand(16)) # adding additional noise to some of the points

# Fit regression model
regr_1 = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=2)
regr_2 = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=5)
regr_1.fit(X, y)
regr_2.fit(X, y)

# Predict
X_test = np.arange(0.0, 5.0, 0.01)[:, np.newaxis]
y_1 = regr_1.predict(X_test)
y_2 = regr_2.predict(X_test)

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize = (14,6))
plt.scatter(X, y, s=20, edgecolor="black", c="darkorange", label="data")
plt.plot(X_test, y_1, color="cornflowerblue", label="max_depth=2", linewidth=2)
plt.plot(X_test, y_2, color="yellowgreen", label="max_depth=5", linewidth=2)
plt.xlabel("data")
plt.ylabel("target")
plt.title("Decision Tree Regression")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
    
![The image is a decision tree regression plot titled 'Decision Tree Regression.' The x-axis is labeled 'data' and ranges from 0 to 5, while the y-axis is labeled 'target' and ranges from approximately -1.5 to 1.5. The plot includes brown data points scattered across the graph. Two regression lines are overlaid on the data points: a blue line representing a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, and a green line representing a decision tree with a maximum depth of 5. The blue line shows a simpler, more generalized fit with fewer steps, while the green line shows a more complex fit with additional steps, capturing more variations in the data. The plot visually compares the performance and complexity of decision trees with different maximum depths.](images/outputs/output_147_0.png)
    
How does the best decision tree look like?

```python
fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,5))
plot_tree(
    regr_1, 
    ax=ax,
    fontsize=10,
    filled=True,
    impurity=False,
    precision=3,
)
ax.set_title("best single decision tree")
```
    
![The image shows a decision tree diagram titled 'best single decision tree.' The root node splits based on the condition x[0] <= 3.133 with 80 samples and a value of 0.122. The left branch (true) leads to a node with the condition x[0] <= 0.514, containing 51 samples and a value of 0.571. This node further splits into two branches: the left branch with 11 samples and a value of 0.052, and the right branch with 40 samples and a value of 0.714. The right branch (false) of the root node leads to a node with the condition x[0] <= 3.85, containing 29 samples and a value of -0.667. This node further splits into two branches: the left branch with 14 samples and a value of -0.452, and the right branch with 15 samples and a value of -0.869. The diagram visually represents the decision-making process of the tree, showing how the data is split based on the feature thresholds and the resulting values at each node.](images/outputs/output_148_1.png)
    
Of course with a single tree we do not get very far, unless the tree becomes absolutely huge. But with a random forest we can aggregate the estimate from many trees to get somewhere nice:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

RFReg = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
RFReg.fit(X, y)

# Predict
X_test = np.arange(0.0, 5.0, 0.01)[:, np.newaxis]
y_1 = regr_1.predict(X_test)
y_rf = RFReg.predict(X_test)

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize = (14,6))
plt.scatter(X, y, s=20, edgecolor="black", c="darkorange", label="data")
plt.plot(X_test, y_1, color="cornflowerblue", label="max_depth=2", linewidth=2)
plt.plot(X_test, y_rf, color="yellowgreen", label="RF", linewidth=2)
plt.xlabel("data")
plt.ylabel("target")
plt.title("Decision Tree Regression")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
    
![The image is a decision tree regression plot titled 'Decision Tree Regression.' The x-axis is labeled 'data' and ranges from 0 to 5, while the y-axis is labeled 'target' and ranges from approximately -1.5 to 1.5. The plot includes brown data points scattered across the graph. Two regression lines are overlaid on the data points: a blue line representing a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, and a green line labeled 'RF' representing a Random Forest model. The blue line shows a simpler, more generalized fit with fewer steps, while the green line shows a more complex fit with additional steps, capturing more variations in the data. The plot visually compares the performance and complexity of a single decision tree versus a Random Forest model in regression tasks](images/outputs/output_150_0.png)

With a bit of leg-work, we can even grab the individual trees predictions to build an interval around the random forest prediction:

```python
y_pred = []
x_pred = []
for tree in RFReg.estimators_ :
    y_pred += list(tree.predict(X_test))
    x_pred += list(X_test[:,0])

plt.figure(figsize = (14,6))
plt.scatter(X, y, s=20, edgecolor="black", c="darkorange", label="data")
plt.plot(X_test, y_1, color="cornflowerblue", label="max_depth=2", linewidth=2)
plt.plot(X_test, y_rf, color="yellowgreen", label="RF", linewidth=2)
sns.lineplot(x=x_pred, y=y_pred, color="yellowgreen", errorbar = "sd") 
plt.xlabel("data")
plt.ylabel("target")
plt.title("Decision Tree Regression")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Potato dataset

Let's try now on the full potato dataset:

```python
X = dfTT
y = df[ "Flesh Colour"]
```

We start by splitting our data in a train and a test set

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

print(f"train set size:", len(y_train))
print(" test set size:", len(y_test))
```

>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> > 
> > 1. 68
> > 2. 18

When it comes to criterion to evaluate the quality of a split and determine the best way to split the data at each node in the tree, we can choose:
* **Square error** (`"squared_error"`, default): This criterion uses the mean squared error (MSE) to evaluate splits. It minimizes the L2 loss by using the mean of the target values in each terminal node. The goal is to reduce the variance within the nodes.
* **Friedman MSE** (`"friedman_mse"`): This criterion also uses mean squared error but incorporates Friedman's improvement score to evaluate potential splits. It aims to improve the traditional MSE by considering the reduction in impurity more effectively.
* **Absolute error** (`"absolute_error"`): This criterion uses the mean absolute error (MAE) to evaluate splits. It minimizes the L1 loss by using the median of the target values in each terminal node. This approach is less sensitive to outliers compared to squared error.
* **Poisson** (`"poisson"`): This criterion uses the reduction in Poisson deviance to evaluate splits. It is particularly useful for count data or when the target variable follows a Poisson distribution.

Let's try squared error and absolute error for the Grid Search:

```python
%%time
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

grid_values = {
    "criterion": ["squared_error" , "absolute_error"],
    "n_estimators":[500], 
    "max_depth":[10,15,20],
    "min_samples_split":np.arange(2,12,2)
}

grid_RF = GridSearchCV(
    RandomForestRegressor(),
    param_grid = grid_values, 
    scoring="r2",
    n_jobs=-1,
    cv=5,
)

grid_RF.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(f"Grid best score (r2): {grid_RF.best_score_:3f}")
print("Grid best parameter (max. r2): ")

for k , v in grid_RF.best_params_.items():
    print(f"{k:>20} : {v}")
```

Let's now look at the feature, i.e. genes, importance:

```python
feature_importance = grid_RF.best_estimator_.feature_importances_

sorted_features = sorted(
    [[X_train.columns[i], abs(feature_importance[i])] for i in range(len(feature_importance))],
    key=lambda x : x[1],
    reverse=True,
)

print("Features sorted per importance in discriminative process")
for f, w in sorted_features:
    print(f"{f:>20}\t{w:.3f}")
```

Tree-based techniques are particularly compelling for several reasons:

- **No Need for Scaling**: Unlike many other machine learning algorithms, tree-based methods do not require feature scaling, simplifying the preprocessing steps and making them more straightforward to implement.
- **Interpretability**: Tree-based models provide clear and interpretable results. The structure of decision trees allows for easy visualization and understanding of how decisions are made at each node, making them highly interpretable.
- **Non-Linear Modeling**: These techniques are capable of modeling complex, non-linear relationships in the data, making them versatile and effective for a wide range of problems.

However, as we have seen, tree-based methods tend to require more time to train, especially as the complexity of the model increases. This trade-off between interpretability, flexibility, and training time is an important consideration when choosing to use tree-based techniques for our modeling needs.
 
# Conclusion 

Throughout this tutorial, we have provided a comprehensive overview of what machine learning (ML) entails and its core principles. We have explored a selection of the numerous algorithms available for both classification and regression tasks, focusing on those implemented in the [scikit-learn library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html). 

However, machine learning is more than just a collection of algorithms; it encompasses a set of methods designed to address important statistical challenges:

- **Regularization Parameters**: Techniques such as L1 or L2 norms, or setting a maximum depth for trees, help manage overfitting by constraining the model's complexity.
- **Cross-Validation Strategies**: These methods are crucial for detecting overfitting and ensuring robust model selection by evaluating performance across multiple subsets of the data.
- **Adapted Metrics**: Choosing the right evaluation metrics is essential for aligning with the specific goals and characteristics of your data, such as handling class imbalances.

# Extra exercices

To further reinforce the concepts covered in this tutorial, we have prepared additional hands-on exercises. These exercises will help you apply what you've learned to real-world datasets.

## Classification: predicting heart disease on the framingham dataset.

Let's start with a classification exercise using data from the Framingham Heart Study. 

The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is a pioneering, long-term epidemiological study focused on understanding the causes of cardiovascular disease within the community of Framingham, Massachusetts. Initiated in 1948 with 5,209 men and women, the study has since expanded to include three generations of participants, resulting in biological specimens and data from nearly 15,000 individuals. This clinically and genetically well-characterized population serves as a valuable scientific resource, maintained under the joint stewardship of Boston University and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). The FHS introduced the concept of risk factors and their combined effects on cardiovascular health, providing invaluable insights into the development and progression of heart disease among a free-living population. Since 1994, the study has also included two groups from minority populations, enriching its diversity and scope.

Let's get the data:

```python
df_heart = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sib-swiss/statistics-and-machine-learning-training/refs/heads/main/data/framingham.csv")
df_heart.dropna(axis=0, inplace=True) # removing rows with NA values.

print(df_heart.shape)

Here, we would like to predict the column the 10 year risk of coronary heart disease (`TenYearCHD`). For that, let's split `X` and `y`:

```python
X_heart = df_heart.drop(columns = "TenYearCHD")
y_heart = df_heart["TenYearCHD"]
```

In the pipeline, `PolynomialFeatures(include_bias=False, interaction_only=True)` is used to generate interaction terms between the features without including higher-order polynomial terms (like squares, cubes, etc.). This approach allows the model to capture the combined effects of different features, which can improve its ability to learn complex relationships in the data. By setting `include_bias=False`, we avoid adding a bias (intercept) term at this stage, as it will be handled by the logistic regression model itself. The `interaction_only=True` parameter ensures that only interaction terms (products of different features) are created, rather than higher-order powers of individual features.

We want to predict `actual`, the actual max temperature of a day. Beforehands, let's explore the data:

```python
import datetime
feature_list = list(features.columns)
labels = features["actual"]

# Dates of training values
months = np.array(features)[:, feature_list.index("month")]
days = np.array(features)[:, feature_list.index("day")]
years = np.array(features)[:, feature_list.index("year")]

# List and then convert to datetime object
dates = [f"{int(year)}-{int(month)}-{int(day)}" for year, month, day in zip(years, months, days)]
dates = [datetime.datetime.strptime(date, "%Y-%m-%d") for date in dates]

# Dataframe with true values and dates
true_data = pd.DataFrame(data={"date": dates, "actual": labels})

plt.xlabel("Date"); 
plt.ylabel("Maximum Temperature (F)")

# Plot the actual values
plt.plot(true_data["date"], true_data["actual"], "b-", label="actual")
plt.xticks(rotation=60)
plt.show()
```

![The image is a line plot displaying the maximum daily temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit over a period from January 2016 to January 2017. The x-axis represents the date, ranging from January 2016 to January 2017, while the y-axis represents the maximum temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, ranging from 40 to 90. The plot shows a blue line that fluctuates, indicating the daily maximum temperatures. The temperatures start around 50 degrees in January 2016, rise to peaks above 80 degrees during the summer months, and then gradually decrease to around 40 degrees by January 2017. The plot visually represents the seasonal variation in maximum temperatures over the course of a year.](images/outputs/output_171_0.png) 

```python

> > ![The image consists of two side-by-side plots comparing feature importance for a predictive model. The left plot, titled 'Feature Importance (MDI),' displays a bar chart with features listed on the y-axis and their importance scores on the x-axis, ranging from approximately -0.2 to 0.6. The features include 'temp_1,' 'average,' 'temp_2,' and 'friend.' The most important feature is 'temp_1,' followed by 'average,' with 'temp_2' and 'friend' showing lower importance and negative values. Error bars indicate the variability or uncertainty in the importance estimates. The right plot, titled 'Permutation Importance (test set),' is a box plot showing the distribution of permutation importance scores for the same features on the test set, with the x-axis ranging from 0.0 to 0.8. 'average' has the highest median importance, followed by 'temp_1,' while 'temp_2' and 'friend' show lower and more varied importance scores. Each box plot includes the median, interquartile range, and potential outliers, providing a visual representation of the spread and central tendency of the importance scores.](images/outputs/output_177_2.png)

> > ![The image is a scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between true values and predicted values. The x-axis represents the true values, ranging from approximately 40 to 90, while the y-axis represents the predicted values, ranging from approximately 50 to 80. Each red dot on the plot corresponds to a data point, showing how well the predicted values match the true values. The plot indicates a general trend where higher true values correlate with higher predicted values, though there is some scatter, suggesting variability in prediction accuracy. At the top of the image, there is a numerical value, 0.8981473578315659, which likely represents a performance metric such as the coefficient of determination (R-squared) or mean absolute error, indicating the model's predictive performance.](images/outputs/output_177_5.png)

The x-axis represents the sample index, ranging from 0 to approximately 1050, and the y-axis represents the CV iteration, ranging from 0 to 4. Each horizontal bar corresponds to a specific CV iteration and shows the range of sample indices included in that iteration. The bars are color-coded, with blue indicating the training set and red indicating the test set. The plot demonstrates how the data is split into training and test sets across five iterations, ensuring that each iteration uses a different block of consecutive samples for testing while the remaining samples are used for training. This approach helps in evaluating the model's performance on different segments of the time series data. ](images/BlockedTimeSeriesSplit.png)

The left panel is a bar chart titled "Feature Importance (MDI)," which shows the Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI) for various features: temp_1, average, temp_2, and friend. The length of each bar represents the relative importance of each feature, with temp_1 having the highest importance, followed by average, while temp_2 and friend show negligible importance. The right panel is a box plot titled "Permutation Importance (test set)," which displays the permutation importance of the same features on a test set. The box plot for the average feature shows the highest median importance with some variability, followed by temp_1, which also exhibits notable importance but with a wider range of values. Both temp_2 and friend demonstrate minimal importance, as indicated by their tightly clustered and low-positioned box plots near zero.](images/outputs/output_180_2.png)
