# Introduction to PyCaret and Galaxy

- **Galaxy**: A web-based platform for data-intensive biomedical research, enabling users to run tools and workflows without coding.
- **PyCaret**: An open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows.
- **Integration**: PyCaret is available as a tool in Galaxy, allowing users to perform machine learning tasks directly from the Galaxy interface.

PyCaret simplifies machine learning by automating tasks like data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. In this tutorial, we will explore how PyCaret can be used within Galaxy to build reliable models, using the LORIS LLR6 model as a case study.

# Use Case: The LORIS LLR6 Model (Chang et al., 2024)

- **LORIS LLR6**: A logistic regression model for predicting patient response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy.
- **Dataset**: LORIS PanCancer, containing clinical, pathologic, and genomic features from 18 solid tumor types.
- **Objective**: Demonstrate how PyCaret can be used to reproduce and evaluate the LORIS LLR6 model, highlighting its automation and efficiency.

# Dataset: LORIS PanCancer

- **Description**: A large dataset of ICB-treated and non-ICB-treated patients across 10 cohorts.
- **Focus**: Chowell_train for training, Chowell_test for testing.
- **Key Features**:
  - Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB)
  - Systemic Therapy History
  - Albumin
  - Cancer Type
  - Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR)
  - Age
  - Response (target: 0 = no benefit, 1 = benefit)
- **Galaxy's Role**: Facilitates easy data upload and management.

---

# Data Preparation for PyCaret

- **Preprocessing**:
  - Extract Chowell_train and Chowell_test from raw data.
  - Select 7 features (TMB, Systemic Therapy History, Albumin, Cancer Type, NLR, Age, Response).
  - Truncate TMB, NLR, Age.
  - One-hot encode Cancer Type.
- **Dockstore**:
  - Handles preprocessing steps.

# Running PyCaret Model Comparison

1. **Upload Data**:
   - Chowell_train_Response.tsv and Chowell_test_Response.tsv from Zenodo.
   - [Zenodo link to files](https://zenodo.org/records/13885908)
2. **Run PyCaret Model Comparison**:
   - Train Dataset (CSV or TSV): Training dataset (Chowell_train_Response.tsv)
   - Test Dataset (CSV or TSV): Testing dataset (Chowell_test_Response.tsv)
   - Select the target column: Response (C22)
   - Task: Classification
   - Only Select Classification Models if you don't want to compare all models: Logistic Regression
3. **Evaluate Model**:
   - Use PyCaret's report to assess performance.
   - Compare with original LORIS LLR6 metrics from Chang et al., 2024.
