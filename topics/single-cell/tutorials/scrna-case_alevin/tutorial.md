This tutorial will take you from raw FASTQ files to a cell x gene data matrix in AnnData format. What's a data matrix, and what's AnnData format? Well you'll find out! Importantly, this is the first step in processing single cell data in order to start analysing it.

>
{: .details}

Currently you have a bunch of strings of `ATGGGCTT` etc. in your sequencing files, and what you need to know is how many cells you have and what genes appear in those cells. These steps are the most computationally heavy in the single cell world, as you're starting with 100s of millions of reads, each with 4 lines of text. Later on in analysis, this data becomes simple gene counts such as 'Cell A has 4 GAPDHs', which is a lot easier to store! Because of this data overload, we have downsampled the FASTQ files to speed up the analysis a bit. Saying that, you're still having to map loads of reads to the massive murine genome, so get yourself a cup of coffee and prepare to analyse!

> <warning-title>For the bench scientists and biologists!</warning-title>
> If you're not used to computing, this tutorial will *not* feel intuitive. It's lots of heavy (and necessary) computational steps with little visible reward. You will still absolutely be able to complete it, but it won't make that much sense.

# Generating a matrix

In this section, we will show you the principles of the initial phase of single-cell RNA-seq analysis: generating expression measures in a matrix. We'll concentrate on droplet-based (rather than plate-based) methodology, since this is the process with most differences with respect to conventional approaches developed for bulk RNA-seq.

Droplet-based data consists of three components: cell barcodes, unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and cDNA reads. To generate cell-wise quantifications we need to:

 * Process cell barcodes, working out which ones correspond to 'real' cells, which to sequencing artefacts, and possibly correct any barcodes likely to be the product of sequencing errors by comparison to more frequent sequences.
 * Map biological sequences to the reference genome or transcriptome.
 * 'De-duplicate' using the UMIs.

This used to be a complex process involving multiple algorithms, or was performed with technology-specific methods (such as 10X's 'Cellranger' tool)  but is now much simpler thanks to the advent of a few new methods. When selecting methodology for your own work you should consider:

 * [STARsolo](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) - a droplet-based scRNA-seq-specific variant of the popular genome alignment method STAR. Produces results very close to those of Cellranger (which itself uses STAR under the hood).
 * [Kallisto/ bustools](https://www.kallistobus.tools/) - developed by the originators of the transcriptome quantification method, Kallisto.
 * [Alevin](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alevin.html) - another transcriptome analysis method developed by the authors of the Salmon tool.

We're going to use Alevin {% cite article-Alevin %} for demonstration purposes, but we do not endorse one method over another.

## Get Data

We've provided you with some example data to play with, a small subset of the reads in a mouse dataset of fetal growth restriction (){% cite Bacon2018 %}). You can also find it in the [study in Single Cell Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/results/tsne) and in [Array Express](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/)), where we downloaded the original FASTQ files.zs This is a study using the Drop-seq chemistry, however this tutorial is almost identical to a 10x chemistry. We will point out the one tool parameter change you will need to run 10x samples. This data is not carefully curated, standard tutorial data - it's real, it's messy, it desperately needs filtering, it has background RNA running around, and most of all it will give you a chance to practice your analysis as if this data were yours.

Down-sampled reads and some associated annotation will be imported in your first step.

> <details-title>Downsampling?</details-title>
>
> The datasets take a while to run in their original size, so we've pre-selected 400,000 lines from the original file to make it run faster. How did we do this?
> - How did I downsample these FASTQ files? You can check out the {% icon galaxy-history %} [ {{ page.downsample_histories[0].label }} ] ( {{ page.input_histories[0].history }}  ) to find out!
>
> - {% icon warning %} If you are in a *live course*, the time to explore this **downsampling history** is not be factored into the schedule. Please instead check it out *after* your course is finished, or if you finish early!
>
{: .details}

Additionally, to map your reads, we have given you a transcriptome to align against (a FASTA) as well as the gene information for each transcript (a gtf) file.

> <details-title>Where did the FASTA and gtf come from?</details-title>
>

{: .question}

Gene-level, rather than transcript-level, quantification is standard in scRNA-seq, which means that the expression level of alternatively spliced RNA molecules are combined to create gene-level values. Droplet-based scRNA-seq techniques only sample one end each transcript, so lack the full-molecule coverage that would be required to accurately quantify different transcript isoforms.

## Generate a transcript to gene map

To generate gene-level quantifications based on transcriptome quantification, Alevin and similar tools require a conversion between transcript and gene identifiers. We can derive a transcript-gene conversion from the gene annotations available in genome resources such as Ensembl. The transcripts in such a list need to match the ones we will use later to build a binary transcriptome index. If you were using spike-ins, you'd need to add these to the transcriptome and the transcript-gene mapping.

In your example data you will see the murine reference annotation as retrieved from Ensembl in GTF format. This annotation contains gene, exon, transcript and all sorts of other information on the sequences. We will use these to generate the transcript/ gene mapping by passing that information to a tool that extracts just the transcript identifiers we need.

{: .question}

It's now time to *parse* (computing term for separating out important information from a larger file) the GTF file using the [rtracklayer](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rtracklayer.html) package in R. This parsing will give us a conversion table with a list of transcript identifiers and their corresponding gene identifiers for counting. Additionally, because we will be generating our own binary index (more later!), we also need to input our FASTA so that it can be filtered to only contain transcriptome information found in the GTF.

## Generate a transcriptome index & quantify!

Alevin collapses the steps involved in dealing with dscRNA-seq into a single process. Such tools need to compare the sequences in your sample to a reference containing all the likely transcript sequences (a 'transcriptome'). This will contain the biological transcript sequences known for a given species, and perhaps also technical sequences such as 'spike ins' if you have those.

> <details-title>How does Alevin work?</details-title>
>
> To be able to search a transcriptome quickly, Alevin needs to convert the text (FASTA) format sequences into something it can search quickly, called an 'index'. The index is in a binary rather than human-readable format, but allows fast lookup by Alevin. Because the types of biological and technical sequences we need to include in the index can vary between experiments, and because we often want to use the most up-to-date reference sequences from Ensembl or NCBI, we can end up re-making the indices quite often. Making these indices is time-consuming! Have a look at the uncompressed FASTA to see what it starts with.
>
{: .details}

We now have:

* Barcode/ UMI reads
* cDNA reads
* transcript/ gene mapping
* filtered FASTA

We can now run Alevin! However, Alevin will inherently do some of its own filtering and thresholding. We will actually use a better tool later (*emptyDrops*) that needs to work on raw outputs. Therefore, we are going to select options to limit Alevin from filtering the outputs.

{: .comment}

This tool will take a while to run. Alevin produces many file outputs, not all of which we'll use. You can refer to the [Alevin documentation](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alevin.html) if you're curious what they all are, but we're most interested in is:

* the matrix itself (*per-cell gene-count matrix (MTX)* - the count by gene and cell)
* the row (cell/ barcode) identifiers (*row index (CB-ids)*) and
* the column (gene) labels (*column headers (gene-ids)*).

For early Drop-Seq samples and single-cell data in general, you might expect a slightly poorer mapping rate. 10x samples are much better these days! This is real data, not test data, after all!

According to this (rough) estimate, your sample has 22,952 cells in it! This entirely inaccurate, because it's currently counting background noise as cells. So we need to do some **Quality Control** (QC)!

{: .question}

{% icon congratulations %} Congratulations - you've made an expression matrix! We could almost stop here. But it's sensible to do some basic QC, and one of the things we can do is look at a barcode rank plot.

# Generating QC Plots

The question we're looking to answer here, is: "do we mostly have a single cell per droplet"? That's what experimenters are normally aiming for, but it's not entirely straightforward to get exactly one cell per droplet. Sometimes almost no cells make it into droplets, other times we have too many cells in each droplet. At a minimum, we should easily be able to distinguish droplets with cells from those without.

{: .hands_on}

## Interpreting the QC plots

This is our own formulation of the barcode plot based on a [discussion](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/362#issuecomment-490160480) we had with community members. The left hand plots with the smooth lines are the main plots, showing the UMI counts for individual cell barcodes ranked from high to low. The right hand plots are density plots from the first one, and the thresholds are generated either using [dropletUtils](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DropletUtils.html) or by the method described in the discussion mentioned above.

![raw droplet barcode plots-400k](../../images/scrna-casestudy/CS1-raw_barcodes-400k.png "400k subsample raw")

Now, the image generated here (400k) isn't the most informative - but you are dealing with a fraction of the reads! If you run the total sample (so identical steps above, but with significantly more time!) you'd get the image below.

![raw droplet barcode plots-total](../../images/scrna-casestudy/CS1-raw_barcodes-total.png "Total sample - 32,579,453 reads - raw")

We expect a sharp drop-off between cell-containing droplets and ones that are empty or contain only cell debris. Then, various proposed thresholds (shown in the different coloured horizontal lines) are calculated by Alevin, to give options of where to put a cut-off line that says "Any barcodes with fewer reads per cell than this cut-off line are discarded, because these are likely background and uninformative." Ideally, this cut-off is clearly at the point where the curve bends, known as the *knee* of the curve.

Now, this data is not an ideal dataset, so for perspective, in an ideal world with a very clean 10x run, data will look a bit more like the following taken from the lung atlas (see the [study in Single Cell Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6653/results/tsne) and the [project submission](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6653/)).

![raw droplet barcode plots - lung atlas](../../images/scrna-casestudy/CS1-lung-atlas-barcodes-raw.png "Pretty data - raw")

You can see the clearer 'knee' bend in this significantly larger and cleaner sample, showing the cut-off between empty droplets and cell-containing droplets.

While we could use any of these calculated thresholds to select cells, there are some more sophisticated methods also available. We will try one called *"emptyDrops"*.

# emptyDrops

In experiments with relatively simple characteristics, the 'knee detection' method works relatively well. But some populations (such as our sample!) present difficulties. For instance, sub-populations of small cells may not be distinguished from empty droplets based purely on counts by barcode. Some libraries produce multiple 'knees' for multiple sub-populations. The [emptyDrops](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1662-y) method has become a popular way of dealing with this. emptyDrops still retains barcodes with high counts, but also adds in barcodes that can be statistically distinguished from the ambient profiles, even if total counts are similar.

## Reformatting for emptyDrops

Alevin outputs MTX format. However, emptyDrops runs on SingleCellExperiment (SCE) format. To get there, we will perform the following steps:

 1. Swap Cells & Genes orientation
 2. Add in gene metadata (gene symbols, mitochondrial information)
 3. Convert to a SingleCellExperiment object

### Transform matrix

First, we need to 'transform' the matrix such that cells are in columns and genes are in rows.

>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Tab-delimited genes file"*: `column headers (gene-ids)` (output of **Alevin** {% icon tool %})

> 4. Rename {% icon galaxy-pencil %} 'salmonKallistoMtxTo10x....:matrix' to `Matrix_table`
{: .hands_on}

The output is a matrix in the correct orientation for the rest of our tools. However, our matrix is looking a bit sparse - for instance, click on `Gene_table`. I don't know about you, but I'd struggle to have a good biological discussion using only Ensembl gene_ids! What I'd really like is the more understandable 'GAPDH' or other gene acronym, as well as information on mitochondrial genes so that I can assess if my cells were stressed out or not. In order to prepare our data for emptyDrops, we're going to combine this information into an object, and it's easiest to add in that information now.

### Add in Gene metadata

We're now going to re-run {% icon galaxy-refresh %} the tool that extracts information from our GTF file, but extract gene information instead of transcript information.

> <hands-on-title>Generate gene information</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [GTF2GeneList](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/ebi-gxa/gtf2gene_list/_ensembl_gtf2gene_list/1.52.0+galaxy0) %} with the following parameters:

>    - *"Suppress header line in output?"*: {% icon galaxy-toggle %} `Yes`

{: .hands_on}

Inspect {% icon galaxy-eye %} the {% icon param-file %} `Gene_Information` object in the history. You have made a new key for gene_id, with gene name and a column of mitochondrial information (false = not mitochondrial, true = mitochondrial). We need to add this information into the {% icon param-file %} salmonKallistoMtxTo10x output `Gene_table`. But we need to keep `Gene_table` in the same order, since it is referenced in the `Matrix_table` by row.

{: .hands_on}

Inspect {% icon galaxy-eye %} your `Annotated_Gene_Table`. That's more like it! You now have `gene_id`, `gene_name`, and `mito` information (just without a header to label them). Now let's get back to your journey to emptyDrops and sophisticated thresholding of empty droplets!

## Convert to SCE format

The tool emptyDrops {% cite article-emptyDrops %} works with a specific form of R object called a *"SingleCellExperiment"*. We need to convert our transformed MTX files into that form, using the DropletUtils Read10x tool:

> <hands-on-title>Converting to SingleCellExperiment format</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. {% tool [DropletUtils Read10x](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/ebi-gxa/dropletutils_read_10x/dropletutils_read_10x/1.0.4+galaxy0) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Expression matrix in sparse matrix format (.mtx)"*: `Matrix_table`
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Gene Table"*: `Annotated_Gene_Table`
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Barcode/cell table"*: `Barcode_table`
>    - *"Should metadata file be added?"*: {% icon galaxy-toggle %} `No`
>
> 2. Rename {% icon galaxy-pencil %} output: `SCE_Object`
{: .hands_on}

Fantastic! Now that our matrix is combined into an object, specifically the SingleCellExperiment format, we can now run emptyDrops! Let's get rid of those background droplets containing no cells!

## Run emptyDrops

If you look at the barcode plots above for the 400k read sample, you'll see this is far too stringent for this subsampled data! To satisfy your curiosity, this minimum threshold would yield around `4332` barcodes for the total sample. Again, the number may vary slightly as the output depends on a large number of random iterations.

We will nevertheless proceed with your majestic annotated expression matrix of ~38 cells, ready to go for further processing and analysis!

{% include _includes/cyoa-choices.html option1="Scanpy" option2="Seurat" default="Scanpy" text="Which toolsuite do you intend to use to analyse your data?

<div class="Scanpy" markdown="1">

The tool suite called Scanpy ({% cite Wolf2018 %}) uses a format called `AnnData`, which is a variant of a file format called `hdf5`. You will now convert your SCE object to an AnnData one!

# Convert to AnnData object

{: .hands_on}

Last but not least, after all these data conversions, your AnnData object is missing some labelling. If you *peek* at our latest output {% icon param-file %} in your {% icon galaxy-history %} history, and check the *vars* categories, you will find one category labelled `NA.` What is this? To find out, you can use a handy tool.

>    - *"What to inspect?"*: `Key-indexed annotation of variables/features (var)`
{: .hands_on}

If you {% icon galaxy-eye %} examine the output {% icon param-file %}, you will find that this `NA.` column is a bunch of True/False outputs.

# Conclusion

{% icon congratulations %} Congrats! You have finished the tutorial!

We have:

 * Examined raw read data, annotations and necessary input files for quantification.
 * Run Alevin and applied emptyDrops instead of Alevin's inbuilt thresholds.
 * Deployed barcode rank plots as a way of quickly assessing the signal present in droplet datasets.
 * Converted these datasets to enable downstream analysis.

You might find the {% icon galaxy-history-answer %} *Answer Key Histories* helpful to check or compare with:
  - {% for h in page.answer_histories %}
      [ {{h.label}} ]( {{h.history}} )
    {% endfor %}

<!-- Only currently want to iterate through the first history, but might want others in the future (different servers!) -->

You can also run this entire tutorial via a {% icon galaxy-workflows-activity %} *Workflow*, after performing the **Get data** step initially.
 - [Tutorial Workflow]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_alevin/workflows/index.md %})

<iframe title="Galaxy Workflow Embed" style="width: 100%; height: 700px; border: none;" src="https://singlecell.usegalaxy.eu/published/workflow?id=9a9bbd8046da7b19&embed=true&buttons=true&about=false&heading=false&minimap=true&zoom_controls=true&initialX=0&initialY=0&zoom=0.33"></iframe>

It may be that you want to combine this object with others like it, for instance, maybe you ran 5 samples, and you are starting with 10 FASTQ files... To do this, you can run that same Workflow on all your files! In fact, that's what we do to set up the datasets for the next tutorial. You can explore applying this tutorial to all seven samples in this dataset, either in the downsampled or whole state.
